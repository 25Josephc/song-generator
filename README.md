A web app to generate lyrics in the style of over 40 artists. The web app was build using React.js and the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) framework.

## Usage

1. **Install Packages**
    ```
    npm install
   ```

2.  **Start the development server**

    ```
    npm start
    ```
    
3.  **Production Build**

    ```
    npm run-script build
    ```
    
## How it Works
A markov model trained for each individual artist from is first used to generate lines of lyrics. The dataset of lyrics is pulled from Lyrics Beast.


To create the rhymes an LSTM was trained to predict a rhyme pattern based on the previous lines and artist style.
The lines of lyrics generated by the markov model are then rearranged to best suite this rhyming style.
